<h1>Hash The Planet</h1>

<p>A simple tool for storing arbitrary data in a central location. Mostly for temporary use.</p>

<p>here is the source: <a href="http://github.com/doug/hashtheplanet">http://github.com/doug/hashtheplanet</a>
If you use it a lot run your own on app engine as I only have so many memcache calls.</p>

<p>This is not intended to be a frontend to memcache, this is for config files that I want to be able to access.
Or being able to post the temporary ip address of something I'm configuring. Or sharing some snipppet with a friend for
only a short while. Some global hash to some arbitrary transient value.
The content can be any string including html if you want if formated when returned, but probably something like json is
a good choice.</p>

<p>It is all backed by App Engine and Memcache.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Read Data</h3>

<pre><code>curl -X GET http://www.hashtheplanet.com/myhash
</code></pre>

<h3>Set Data</h3>

<pre><code>curl -X POST http://www.hashtheplanet.com/myhash?secret=mysecret&amp;value=myvalue
</code></pre>

<h3>Delete Data</h3>

<pre><code>curl -X DELETE http://www.hashtheplanet.com/myhash?secret=mysecret
</code></pre>

<h3>Extras</h3>

<p>For convenience a read call with a secret acts as a post to set the data.</p>

<pre><code>curl -X GET http://www.hashtheplanet.com/myhash?secret=mysecret&amp;value=myvalue === curl -X POST http://www.hashtheplanet.com/myhash?secret=mysecret&amp;value=myvalue
</code></pre>

<p>This is so you can just do it from the browser window.</p>
